As auth is not yet implemented, you must to go https://auto-tribe.vercel.app/garage to get to the main application

Feel free to add new cars and check out whats going on, but please do not delete 'BMW M3' as I am currently working on the diary entry styling and connected to the same db.

Registration numbers must include the letter A due to sandbox limitations on the API i am using, so heres some you could use:

E3XAG, E30ASG
